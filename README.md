# Analyze-Death-Age-Difference-of-Right-Handers-with-Left-Handers
This project investigates the misconception that left-handed people die younger than right-handed people. It employs data analysis and Bayesian statistics to challenge this notion.

Abstract:

The project analyzes data on handedness prevalence and age distribution to explore if the perceived age difference stems from historical biases against left-handedness.

Key Findings:

The project utilizes data from a National Geographic survey and research on left-handedness prevalence by Gilbert and Wysocki.
It employs Python libraries like pandas and Bayesian statistics to calculate probabilities of reaching certain ages based on handedness.
The findings reveal that societal factors, not handedness itself, are likely responsible for the perception of earlier death for left-handed individuals.

Running the Project:

Clone this repository.
Ensure you have Python and required libraries (pandas, matplotlib) installed.
Run the Jupyter notebook (script.ipynb) to execute the analysis and visualizations.

Future Scope:

Conduct longitudinal studies to track handedness trends and mortality rates over extended periods.
Include international data to explore the broader influence of societal factors.
Investigate causal relationships between handedness and age at death.
Analyze the impact of cultural and environmental factors on handedness prevalence.
Collaborate with other fields to gain a more holistic understanding.

Conclusion:

This project sheds light on the complex relationship between handedness and age at death. By leveraging data analysis and Bayesian statistics, it demonstrates that societal norms, rather than handedness itself, likely contribute to the misconception about left-handed people having a shorter lifespan. The project opens doors for further research to explore the multifaceted nature of handedness and its potential associations with longevity.
